  Company: {company_name} ({ticker})

  === SEC EDGAR Filings (Last 24 Hours) ===
  {edgar_summary}

  === Analyst Research (BlueMatrix) ===
  {bluematrix_summary}

  === Market Data (FactSet) ===
  {factset_summary}

  === Additional Context (RAG) ===
  {relevant_chunks}

  Task: Write ONE paragraph (75-125 words) summarizing the most material developments across all sources.

  Structure:
  - Lead sentence: Most material event with specific details (prioritize: regulatory filings > analyst actions > price movements)
  - 2-3 supporting sentences: Context from other sources, impact, and implications
  - Closing sentence: Key takeaway or forward-looking perspective

  Requirements:
  - Use active voice and specific numbers/dates
  - Synthesize across sources (e.g., "Following the 8-K filing, Goldman upgraded the stock...")
  - Cite sources inline: "per 8-K filed 11/6", "Goldman Sachs noted", "stock gained 5.2%"
  - Professional, factual tone
  - Exactly 75-125 words
  - If a source has no data, omit it (don't mention the absence)

  Output only the paragraph text, no commentary.
